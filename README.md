# Galaga
This is my recreation of Galaga using Raylib and C++.

You will play through 3 waves, the first 2 waves being an introductory and the third wave being a randomized wave that will continue to throw enemies at you until you lose all lives. Your goal is to set the high score.

During the process of coding this, I learned how to use Raylib to create graphics and how to update the graphics to create a video game.
