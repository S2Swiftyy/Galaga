# Galaga
This is my recreation of Galaga using Raylib and C++.

You will play through 3 waves, the first 2 waves being an introductory and the third wave being a randomized wave that will continue to throw enemies at you until you lose all lives. Your goal is to set the high score.

During the process of coding this, I learned how to use Raylib to create graphics and how to update the graphics to create a responsive video game that takes input from the user to update the game in real time. The creation of this game also helped me to learn about character management in order to progress through levels or target certain areas.
